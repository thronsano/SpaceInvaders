# SpaceInvaders
University project used for learning about Java networking and JavaFX. 
The project simulates two servers and a scheduler which distributes work amongst them. They render frames based on user's input, then send them back to him where the frames are displayed. 

Includes a basic concept of vectors and movement inspired by my Unity game engine experience.
